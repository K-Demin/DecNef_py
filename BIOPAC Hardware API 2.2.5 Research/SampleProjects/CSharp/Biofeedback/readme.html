		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		Biofeedback is a method of training subjects to gain some control over physiological response. This usually involves
		monitoring the subject's physiological signal and presenting some visual, auditory, or physical stimulus.  The stimulus
		reacts according to the subject's physiological response.
		</p>
		<h2>Galvanic Skin Response (Electrodermal Activity)</h2>
		<p>
		One of the most common methods of training a person to relax is to monitor eccrine activity.
		Electrodermal Activity is the measure of skin's conductiveness.  As a person's stress level increases,
		the body begins to perspire.  Increased eccrine activity (perspiration) increases the skin's conductiveness.
		</p>
		<h2>Design</h2>
		<p>
		This basic Biofeedback system is designed to train a subject to relax.  The subject is connected to the MP device
		via the TSD203 and EDA100C.  Amplifier settings can be found in the documentation that shipped with your MP System.
		The subject is asked to keep the red circle inside the green circle.  The green circle represents the desired relaxation
		state and the red circle represents the subject's stress level.
		</p>
		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<p>
		As soon as the application is launched, it calls on <span class="fn">initAcquistionUnit()</span>.
		Using the Hardware API, this function configures the MP device to acquire on channel 1 at 500 Hz.
		It also starts the acquisition.
		</p>
		<p>
		The form contains a timer called <span class="fn">updateTimer</span> that has a tick interval of 500 msec.
		The tick event is handled by the <span class="fn">UpdateScreen()</span> function which redraws the circles.
		The red circle's diameter is determined by the function called <span class="fn">GetCircleDiameter()</span>.
		</p>
		<h2>GetCircleDiameter()</h2>
		<p>
		The <span class="fn">GetCircleDiameter()</span> calls the Hardware API function <span class="fn">getMostRecentSample()</span>.
		Since EDA does not drastically change within a short period of time, polling the MP device for the most recent sample will suffice.
		Before <span class="fn">GetCircleDiameter()</span> returns, the EDA voltage level is scaled;  zero volts maps to 50 pixels and
		10 volts maps to 600 pixels.
		</p>

		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<ul>
				<li>Calls to the API method <span class="fn">connectMPDev()</span> need to be modified to reflect your MP device configuration</li>
				<li>MPDevImports.cs is the C# wrapper for the Hardware API's methods</li>
		</ul>
