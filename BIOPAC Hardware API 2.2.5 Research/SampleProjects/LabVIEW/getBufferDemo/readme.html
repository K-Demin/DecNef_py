		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>
		This sample project demonstrates how to acquire data from the MP device in LabVIEW using the BIOPAC Hardware API.
		There are three VIs in this project. The VI getBufferDemo160 is configured for use with the MP160, the VI 
		getBufferDemo150 is configured for use with the MP150, and the VI getBufferDemo36 is configured for use with the MP36R.

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		This project utilizes the BIOPAC Hardware API function <span class="fn">getMPBuffer()</span>.  According to its
		specification, this function does not allow for real-time data processing, analysis or plotting.  However, it is good
		for acquiring data for a short interval and at a high sampling rate.
		</p>
		<h2>Front Panel</h2>
		<p>
		The Front Panel is comprised of three Waveform Charts that are hard wired to plot data from 3 analog channels.
		It also has a configuration section that must be modified for your MP device configuration (see <span class="fn">Figure 1</span>).
		In accordance to the specification of the <span class="fn">getMPBuffer()</span> function, the number of samples to acquire must be
		specified. After running the VI, configure the DLL, configure the acquisition, and
		then press the "Start" button to initiate the acquisition. The VI will block until the desired number of samples has been
		acquired or an error occurs.
		</p>
		<h2>Block Diagram</h2>
		<p>
		The Block Diagram consists of several Call Library Function Nodes.  These nodes interface with the BIOPAC Hardware API.
		<span class="fn">Figure 2</span> is the key section of the block diagram.  It starts the data acquisition, calls to the
		<span class="fn">getMPBuffer()</span> function and plots the samples in the appropriate Waveform Charts.
		Since there are three active channels, the VI allocates an array that can hold three times the number of samples.
		The array that the <span class="fn">getMPBuffer()</span> function returns is interleaved and must be decimated.

		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				There are several ways of calling Shared Libraries (DLLs) from LabVIEW.  This project uses
		  		the Call Library Function to call functions from the BIOPAC Hardware API in LabVIEW.  Please
		  		read LabVIEW's documentation regarding usage of the Call Library Function.
